GUI tools
1. Shoes 4
  Shoes is at present the most widely used way to create graphical programs.  It provides an extremely simple and straightforward graphics API, and has been used for both teaching and building applications. 
  Shoes runs on JRuby, which is a Ruby interpreter written in Java. It allows Ruby programs to run on the Java Virtual Machine(JVM) with easy access to any Java library. Although it has not always been true, JRuby today is stable, mature, and sometimes even faster than MRI(the main Ruby interpreter).
  == WARNING: Shoes needs "JRuby" 

2. Ruby/Tk
   This was the first one made available and has long been part
	 of the standard Ruby installation. Though it is not as popular
	 as it was then, it is still in use.
	 Most would say that  Tk is showing in age, though it is inlcuded
	 in the Ruby standard library.

3. Ruby/GTK3
   The GTL library is a byproduct of the GIMP(GNU Image Manipulation
	 Program); GIMP Toolkit.
	 Ruby/GTK3 is a library that allows Ruby application to use the GTK+
	 library. 
	 GTK+ has such concepts as frames, windows, dialog boxes, and layout managers. It has a rich set of widgets.
