Mikio is a Japanese who hate to live here and leave for somewhere.
hello, it's Thursday one day of June and I am at the Coxwell library.
Here are no seats to get, although some seats we have are occupied by documents of two persons. They occupied two table scattering papers which avoid us sitting them. I get angry at them but I couldn't say anything to them. I want to blame for their non-concern with the others. I am very uncomfortable with them likely the reclining seat in the plane and sitting in the train.
